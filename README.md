changelog
// 5/03/24 created maede clock and created initial picture with steam punk gear idea
// 7/03/24 created first working gear with so called "flick" bug where full rotation would occur once every minute in a sudden motion
// 7/03/24 created basic gear function for drawing gears complete various bug fixes
// 10/03/24 began creating additional ability for gears to have gradient colour
//14/03/24 abandoned gradient colour gears in favour of pursuing a simplified steampunk asthetic
//19/03/24 made testing ellipse actually toggleable on draw_gear. completed minute gear finally and mechanism between second gear and minute gear
//19/03/24 added unique gear colours to existing primary gears eg second minute. added hour gear and mechanism. chose colours primaryily based on steam punk colour palete eg copper brass silver etc.fixed test ellipse (was possitioned incorrectly at bottom of gears meaning they were upsidedown). added gold2 colour to add some contrast between mechannism gears as they were visually merging due to low contrast. added "speedup" to all gear rotates to allow future work on alarm map
//21/03/24 completed final gear, updated final gear colour,added 3rd gold colour for additional contrast added alarm function using speedup, added day/night ambiance using radial gradients mapped to milliseconds for flickering effect, experimented with different background colours but found they caused the gears to lag for some unknown reason so reverted to original background colour
